BUCKMINSTER 0.2.0 (REV 0002) 24 May 2013

- Decrease likelihood that two vertices will have the same 'key' in very large meshes. (#5)
+ Ribbon component... (#2)
  * handles open meshes (sort of) and can be animated.
  * option to add vertices to 'ribboned edges' to preserve geometry during subdivision.
+ Extrude component, using new 'per-vertex' offset. (#2)
- Don't allow creation of faces with less that two edges.
- Increase stability of Chebychev Net method. (#6)
+ Chebychev Net can extend beyond 'axis', covering more of the surface, and now includes option to animate. (#7)
+ Append one mesh to another.
- LaceDual adjusted to output a mesh (instead of lines). Uses naked halfedge pairs to represent 'web' elements.
+ 3D FE analysis using matrix stiffness method... (#4)
  * uses Math.NET Numerics dll.
  * outputs displacements and bar forces.
  * extraction component included to get required data from mesh.
+ Unit tests for stiffness method. (#4)
+ Alot of tidying up and refactoring! (#3)
